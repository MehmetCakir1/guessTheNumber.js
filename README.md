# Guess The Number With Javascript
[](https://mehmetcakir1.github.io/guessTheNumberWithJS/)
<br>
In this project:
* I used generally Bootstrap 5 for layout.
* I  also used CSS3 for some parts.
* I designed a home page and 3 subpages which are linked to the home page with a button.<br>
* I used Math.random() method so that the answer always changes when the page reload.
* If you click the easy mode button,you will face the game in which you should find the number in between just 1 and 10.<br>
  And you will have 3 rights to find the number.<br>
* If you click the medium mode button,you will face the game in which you should find the number in between 1 and 50.<br>
  And you will have 5 rights to find the number.<br>
* If you click the hard mode button,you will face the game in which you should find the number in between 1 and 100.<br>
  And you will have 7 rights to find the number.<br>
* You can not play again if you don't press the Play Again button. <br>
* I used capturing method to be able to access the buttons's innerText.<br>
* In each mode, you can not press any button except "Play Again" button if you don't have any right to play. <br>
* If you find the answer, you will see "CONGRATULATIONS" in the screen.<br>
* if you don't find the answer, you wil see "You Have Lost" and "The Answer Was ..." in the screen.<br>
* If you want to change the number you enterd,you can press "CLEAR" button.
